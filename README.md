# Hand Tracking Particle Flow

**Hand Tracking Particle Flow** is a real-time interactive visual experiment built with **JavaScript**, **Canvas**, and **MediaPipe Hands**.  
It transforms human hand movements into a smooth, generative particle system that reacts to speed, direction, and gestures.

This project is inspired by modern creative coding and interactive installations.

## Features

- **Real-time hand tracking** using MediaPipe
- **Smooth particle flow field**
- **Velocity-based particle behavior**
- **Multi-finger particle emission**
- **Dynamic color transitions**
- **Optimized for performance**
- **Gesture-responsive visuals**

---

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **HTML5 Canvas**
- **MediaPipe Hands**
- **Web Camera API**

---

## How It Works

- The camera detects the hand using MediaPipe.
- Key hand landmarks are tracked in real time.
- Particles are emitted from fingertip positions.
- Particle velocity and glow intensity react to hand speed.
- A lightweight flow field adds organic motion.
- Colors smoothly evolve based on movement dynamics.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the project folder.

3. Serve the project using a local server (required for camera access):

or
4. Open the browser and allow camera access.

## Performance Notes

- Particle count is capped to ensure smooth rendering.
- Motion smoothing and damping reduce jitter.
- Designed to run smoothly on modern browsers.

---

## Use Cases

- Creative coding experiments
- Interactive web installations
- Digital art projects
- Portfolio projects
- Motion-based UI exploration

---

## Future Improvements

- Gesture-based mode switching (open/closed hand)
- Mobile optimization
- Multi-hand support
- Shader-based rendering (WebGL)
- Audio-reactive particles
